# VR Pong Development Handover Document
**Date: December 23, 2024**

## Changes Made During This Session

### 1. Score Labels Enhancement
- Added labels above scores:
  - "YOU" on left wall (AI side)
  - "PONG MASTER" on right wall (player side)
- Adjusted text size and positioning:
  - Font size: 72px
  - Position: 1/5th from top
  - Maintained glow effect matching score style

### 2. Edge Detection Improvements
**Problem**: Ball occasionally slipping through paddle edges
**Solution Implemented**:
```javascript
// In Ball.js
- Increased buffer zone to 0.03 units
- Widened edge detection to 45% of paddle width
- Added overlap check (0.05 units)
- Clamped deflection angles (-0.9 to 0.9)
```

### 3. AI Speed Enhancement
**Problem**: AI needed more challenge during long volleys
**Solution Implemented**:
```javascript
// In Paddle.js
this.initialSpeed = 0.015;    // Starting speed
this.currentSpeed = this.initialSpeed;
this.speedIncrement = 0.001;  // Speed increase per movement
this.maxSpeed = 0.04;         // Maximum speed (increased from 0.03)
```

## Implementation Details

### Edge Detection Logic
- Added buffer zone around paddle for more reliable collision detection
- Improved edge hit registration with overlap checking
- Maintained consistent ball behavior while fixing edge issues
- No changes to scoring or out-of-bounds logic

### AI Acceleration System
- Starts at base speed (0.015)
- Gradually increases during continuous movement
- Resets to initial speed when catching up to ball
- Capped at 0.04 maximum speed
- All sounds and haptics remain unchanged

## Latest Commits
1. "Switched player labels and adjusted text positioning"
2. "Improved paddle edge detection with buffer zones"
3. "Increased AI paddle maximum speed to 0.04"

## Known Issues and Monitoring Points
1. Edge detection may need further tuning based on extended gameplay
2. AI speed progression might need adjustment based on player feedback
3. Label positioning might need refinement for different VR headsets
